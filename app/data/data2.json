            "content": "Systems are needed to support access to and analysis of large heterogeneous scientific datasets. We developed PerCon, a data management and analysis environment, to support such activities. PerCon processes and integrates data gathered via queries to existing data providers to create a personal digital library of data. Users may then search, browse, visualize and annotate the data as they proceed with analysis and interpretation. Interpretation in PerCon takes place in a visual workspace in which multiple data visualizations and annotations are placed into spatial arrangements based on the current task. The system watches for patterns in the user\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u20ac\u00c2\u2122s data selection and organization and through mixed-initiative interaction assists users by suggesting potentially relevant data from unexplored data sources. PerCon\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u20ac\u00c2\u2122s data location and analysis capabilities were evaluated in a controlled study with 24 users. Study participants had to locate and analyze heterogeneous weather and river data with and without the visual workspace and mixed-initiative interaction, respectively. Results indicate that the visual workspace facilitated information representation and aided in the identification of relationships between datasets. The system\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u20ac\u00c2\u2122s suggestions encouraged data exploration, leading participants to identify more evidence of correlation among data streams and more potential interactions among weather and river data.",

            "content": "In previous papers SC05, SBC+07, some of us predicted the end of \"one size fits all\" as a commercial relational DBMS paradigm. These papers presented reasons and experimental evidence that showed that the major RDBMS vendors can be outperformed by 1-2 orders of magnitude by specialized engines in the data warehouse, stream processing, text, and scientific database markets. Assuming that specialized engines dominate these markets over time, the current relational DBMS code lines will be left with the business data processing (OLTP) market and hybrid markets where more than one kind of capability is required. In this paper we show that current RDBMSs can be beaten by nearly two orders of magnitude in the OLTP market as well. The experimental evidence comes from comparing a new OLTP prototype, H-Store, which we have built at M.I.T. to a popular RDBMS on the standard transactional benchmark, TPC-C. We conclude that the current RDBMS code lines, while attempting to be a \"one size fits all\" solution, in fact, excel at nothing. Hence, they are 25 year old legacy code lines that should be retired in favor of a collection of \"from scratch\" specialized engines. The DBMS vendors (and the research community) should start with a clean sheet of paper and design systems for tomorrow's requirements, not continue to push code lines and architectures designed for yesterday's needs.",

            "content": "Prior studies show that knowledge work is characterized by highly interlinked practices, including task, file and window management. However, existing personal information management tools primarily focus on a limited subset of knowledge work, forcing users to perform additional manual configuration work to integrate the different tools they use. In order to understand tool usage, we review literature on how users' activities are created and evolve over time as part of knowledge worker practices. From this we derive the activity life cycle, a conceptual framework describing the different states and transitions of an activity. The life cycle is used to inform the design of Laevo, a temporal activity-centric desktop interface for personal knowledge work. Laevo allows users to structure work within dedicated workspaces, managed on a timeline. Through a centralized notification system which doubles as a to-do list, incoming interruptions can be handled. Our field study indicates how highlighting the temporal nature of activities results in lightweight scalable activity management, while making users more aware about their ongoing and planned work.",

Our system \"Presentation Sensei\" is equipped with a microphone and camera to analyze a presentation by combining speech and image processing techniques. Based on the results of the analysis, the system gives the speaker instant feedback with respect to the speaking rate, eye contact with the audience, and timing. It also alerts the speaker when some of these indices exceed predefined warning thresholds. After the presentation, the system generates visual summaries of the analysis results for the speaker's self-examinations. Our goal is not to improve the content on a semantic level, but to improve the delivery of it by reducing inappropriate basic behavior patterns. We asked a few test users to try the system and they found it very useful for improving their presentations. We also compared the system's output with the observations of a human evaluator. The result shows that the system successfully detected some inappropriate behavior. The contribution of this work is to introduce a practical recognition-based human training system and to show its feasibility despite the limitations of state-of-the-art speech and video recognition technologies.",

MultiPresenter allows presenters to organize and present pre-made and dynamic presentations that take advantage of a very large display space accessed from a personal laptop. Presenters can use the extra space to provide long-term persistency of information to the audience. Our design deliberately separates content generation (authoring) from the presentation of content. We focus on supporting presentation flow and a variety of presentation styles, ranging from automated, scripted sequences of pre-made slides to highly dynamic ad-hoc, and non-linear content. By providing smooth transition between these styles, presenters can easily alter the flow of content during a presentation to adapt to an audience or to change emphasis in response to emerging interests. We describe our goals, rationale and the design process, providing a detailed description of the current version of the system, and discuss our experience using it throughout a one-semester first year computer science course.",

            "content": "The Big Data problem is characterized by the so called 3V features: Volume - a huge amount of data, Velocity - a high data ingestion rate, and Variety - a mix of structured data, semi-structured data, and unstructured data. The state-of-the-art solutions to the Big Data problem are largely based on the MapReduce framework (aka its open source implementation Hadoop). Although Hadoop handles the data volume challenge successfully, it does not deal with the data variety well since MapReduce enforces a key-value data model along with a row-oriented data processing strategy and bundles the data processing model with the underlying concurrent programming model. This paper presents epiC, an extensible system to tackle the Big Data\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u20ac\u00c2\u2122s data variety challenge. epiC introduces a general Actor-like concurrent programming model, independent of the data processing models, for specifying parallel computations. Users process multi-structured datasets with appropriate epiC extensions, the implementation of a data processing model best suited for the data type and auxiliary code for mapping that data processing model into epiC\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u20ac\u00c2\u2122s concurrent programming model. Like Hadoop, programs written in this way can be automatically parallelized and the runtime system takes care of fault tolerance and inter-machine communications. We present the design and implementation of epiC\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u20ac\u00c2\u2122s concurrent programming model. We also present two customized data processing model, an optimized MapReduce extension and a relational model, on top of epiC.

Rather than exposing real-world data and functionality through proprietary and tightly-coupled systems, we propose to make them an integral part of the Web. As a result, smart things become easier to build upon. Popular Web languages (e.g., HTML, Python, JavaScript, PHP) can be used to easily build applications involving smart things and users can leverage well-known Web mechanisms (e.g., browsing, searching, bookmarking, caching, linking) to interact and share these devices. In this paper, we begin by describing the Web of Things architecture and best-practices based on the RESTful principles that have already contributed to the popular success, scalability, and modularity of the traditional Web. We then discuss several prototypes designed in accordance with these principles to connect environmental sensor nodes and an energy monitoring system to the World Wide Web.

Contextualized in the broader literature of open science, this article proposes open GIS should include eight dimensions related to data, software, hardware, standards, research, publication, funding, and education. For the GIS community, open GIS offers four exciting opportunities: (1) technology-driven opportunities for addressing challenges posed by the (spatial) big data deluge; (2) application-led opportunities for confronting the problems of a rapidly changing planet; (3) curiosity-inspired, crowd-powered opportunities for the development of an open and geographic citizen science; and (4) education-focused opportunities for implementing the vision of a spatial university. Although there are academic, legal, social/political, and environmental impediments for the practice of open GIS, open GIS will become increasingly important in shaping our research and educational agendas in the future.",

Finally, we observed how electronic affor- dances like synchronization across devices helped provide functionality that would not have been possible with paper documents. This paper contributes new information about how electronic reading solutions fit into real world reading workflows.",

            "content": "Variance in business process execution can be the result of several situations, such as disconnection between documented models and business operations, workarounds in spite of process execution engines, dynamic change and exception handling, flexible and ad-hoc approaches, and collaborative and/or knowledge intensive work. It is imperative that effective support for managing process variance be extended to organizations mature in their BPM (Business Process Management) uptake so that they can ensure organization wide consistency, promote reuse and capitalize on their BPM investments. Process variants are complex objects that contain features of different dimensions, such as variant design or variant execution data. This paper provides a technique for effective utilization of the adaptations manifested in process variants. In particular, we will present a facility for discovery of preferred variants through effective search and retrieval based on the notion of process similarity, where multiple aspects of the process variants are compared according to specific query requirements. The major advantage of this approach is the ability to provide a quantitative measure for the similarity between process variants, which further facilitates various BPM activities such as process reuse, analysis and discovery.",

            "content": "Service discovery is a process of locating, or discovering, one or more documents, that describe a particular service. Most of the current service discovery approaches perform syntactic matching, that is, they retrieve services descriptions that contain particular keywords from the user\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u20ac\u00c2\u2122s query. This often leads to poor discovery results, because the keywords in the query can be semantically similar but syntactically different, or syntactically similar but semantically different from the terms in a service description. Another drawback of the existing service discovery mechanisms is that the query-service matching score is calculated taking into account only the keywords from the user\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u20ac\u00c2\u2122s query and the terms in the service descriptions. Thus, regardless of the context of the service user and the context of the services providers, the same list of results is returned in response to a particular query. This paper presents a novel approach for service discovery that uses ontologies to capture the semantics of the user\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u20ac\u00c2\u2122s query, of the services and of the contextual information that is considered relevant in the matching process.",

In this paper we consider the problem of quantitatively assessing context relevance. For this purpose we are assuming that users can imagine a situation described by a contextual feature, and judge if this feature is relevant for their decision making task. We have designed a UI suited for acquiring such information in a travel planning scenario. In fact, this interface is generic and can also be used for other domains (e.g., music). The experimental results show that it is possible to identify the contextual factors that are relevant for the given task and that the relevancy depends on the type of the place of interest to be included in the plan.",

For instance, when recommending a holiday destination, a CARS could take into account whether the trip will happen in summer or winter. It is unclear, however, which contextual factors are important and to which degree they influence user ratings. A large amount of data and complex context-aware predictive models must be exploited to understand these relationships. In this paper, we take a new approach for assessing and modeling the relationship between contextual factors and item ratings. Rather than using the traditional approach to data collection, where recommendations are rated with respect to real situations as participants go about their lives as normal, we simulate contextual situations to more easily capture data regarding how the context influences user ratings. To this end, we have designed a methodology whereby users are asked to judge whether a contextual factor (e.g., season) influences the rating given a certain contextual condition (e.g., season is summer). Based on the analyses of these data, we built a context-aware mobile recommender system that utilizes the contextual factors shown to be important. In a subsequent user evaluation, this system was preferred to a similar variant that did not exploit contextual information.",

The problem has nonetheless been approached under different views and formulations in IR and RS respectively, giving rise to different models, methodologies, and metrics, with little convergence between both fields. In this poster we explore the adaptation of diversity metrics, techniques, and principles from ad-hoc IR to the recommendation task, by introducing the notion of user profile aspect as an analogue of query intent. As a particular approach, user aspects are automatically extracted from latent item features. Empirical results support the proposed approach and provide further insights.",

            "content": "Standard Collaborative Filtering (CF) algorithms make use of interactions between users and items in the form of implicit or explicit ratings alone for generating recommendations. Similarity among users or items is calculated purely based on rating overlap in this case,without considering explicit properties of users or items involved, limiting their applicability in domains with very sparse rating spaces. In many domains such as movies, news or electronic commerce recommenders, considerable contextual data in text form describing item properties is available along with the rating data, which could be utilized to improve recommendation quality.In this paper, we propose a novel approach to improve standard CF based recommenders by utilizing latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) to learn latent properties of items, expressed in terms of topic proportions, derived from their textual description. We infer user's topic preferences or persona in the same latent space,based on her historical ratings. While computing similarity between users, we make use of a combined similarity measure involving rating overlap as well as similarity in the latent topic space. This approach alleviates sparsity problem as it allows calculation of similarity between users even if they have not rated any items in common. Our experiments on multiple public datasets indicate that the proposed hybrid approach significantly outperforms standard user Based and item Based CF recommenders in terms of classification accuracy metrics such as precision, recall and f-measure.",

Among the difficulties faced by these systems is the problem of overwhelming the user with a vast amount of data, often referred to as information overload. The problem has escalated with the ever increasing issues of time constraints and the extensive use of handheld devices. The use of context is one possible way out helping with this situation. To provide a more robust approach to context gathering we propose the use of Social Web technologies alongside the Semantic Web. As the social web is heavily used it could provide a better understanding of a user\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u20ac\u00c2\u2122s interests and intentions. The proposed system gathers information about users from their social web identities and enriches it with ontological knowledge. Thus an interest model for the user can be created which can serve as a good source of contextual knowledge. This work bridges the gap between the user and system searches by analyzing the virtual existence of a user and making interesting recommendations accordingly.",

We have implemented a recommender prototype for browsing the Uffizi Gallery digital picture collection. Then, we investigated the effectiveness of the proposed approach, based on the users satisfaction. The obtained preliminary experimental results show that our approach is quite promising and encourages further research in this direction.",

Likewise, since the release of new platforms enriches them with new features and makes DL more powerful and effective, the number of web sites integrating these kind of tools is rapidly growing. In this paper we propose an approach for the exploitation of digital libraries for personalization goal in cultural heritage scenario. Specifically, we tried to integrate FIRSt (Folksonomy-based Item Recommender syStem), a content-based recommender system developed at the University of Bari, and Fedora, a flexible digital library architecture, in a framework for the adaptive fruition of cultural heritage implemented within the activities of the CHAT research project. In this scenario, the role of the digital library was to store information (such as textual and multimedial ones) about paintings gathered from the Vatican Picture Gallery and to provide them in a multimodal and personalized way through a PDA device given to a user before her visit in a museum. This paper describes the system architecture of our recommender system and its integration in the framework implemented for the CHAT project, showing how this recommendation model has been applied to recommend the artworks located at the Vatican Picture Gallery (Pinacoteca Vaticana), providing users with a personalized museum tour tailored on their tastes. The experimental evaluation we performed also confirmed that these recommendation services are really able to catch the real user preferences thus improving their experience in cultural heritage fruition. &copy; 2010 Springer-Verlag.",

This approach supports multiple dimensions, profiling information, and hierarchical aggregation of recommendations. The article also presents a multidimensional rating estimation method capable of selecting two-dimensional segments of ratings pertinent to the recommendation context and applying standard collaborative filtering or other traditional two-dimensional rating estimation techniques to these segments. A comparison of the multidimensional and two-dimensional rating estimation approaches is made, and the tradeoffs between the two are studied. Moreover, the article introduces a combined rating estimation method, which identifies the situations where the MD approach outperforms the stan- dard two-dimensional approach and uses the MD approach in those situations and the standard two-dimensional approach elsewhere. Finally, the article presents a pilot empirical study of the combined approach, using a multidimensional movie recommender system that was developed for implementing this approach and testing its performance.",

News contents and user preferences are described in terms of concepts appearing in a set of domain ontologies. Based on the similarities between item descriptions and user profiles, and the se-mantic relations between concepts, content-based and collaborative recommendation models are supported by the system. In this paper, we evaluate a model that personalizes the order in which news articles are shown to the user according to his long-term interest profile, and other model that reorders the news items lists taking into account the current semantic context of interest of the user. The combination of those models is investigated showing significant improvements on the experimental tasks performed.",

We offer SocialFusion as a system capable of systematically integrating such diverse mobile, social, and sensing input streams and effectuating the appropriate context-aware output action. We explain some of the major challenges that SocialFusion must overcome. We describe some preliminary results that we have obtained in implementing the SocialFusion vision.",

Methods for generating context-aware recommendations were classified into the pre-filtering, post-filtering and contextual modeling approaches. This paper focuses on comparing the pre-filtering, the post-filtering, the contextual modeling and the un-contextual approaches and on identifying which method dominates the others and under which circumstances. Although some of these methods have been studied independently, no prior research compared the relative performance to determine which of them is better. This paper proposes an effective method of comparing the three methods to incorporate context and selecting the best alternatives. As a result, it provides analysts with a practical suggestion on how to pick a good approach in an effective manner to improve the performance of a context-aware recommender system.",

However, no systematic study measuring how much the contextual information really matters in building customer models in personalization applications has been done before. In this paper, we study how important the contextual information is when predicting customer behavior and how to use it when building customer models. It is done by conducting an empirical study across a wide range of experimental conditions. The experimental results show that context does matter when modeling the behavior of individual customers and that it is possible to infer the context from the existing data with reasonable accuracy in certain cases. It is also shown that significant performance improvements can be achieved if the context is \"cleverly\" modeled, as described in this paper. These findings have significant implications for data miners and marketers. They show that contextual information does matter in personalization and companies have different opportunities to both make context valuable for improving predictive performance of customers' behavior and decreasing the costs of gathering contextual information.",

In this paper we consider a particular kind of context aware recommendation task\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u20ac\u00c2\u201dselecting music content that fits a place of interest (POI). To address this problem we have used emotional tags attached by a users\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u20ac\u00c2\u2122 population to both music and POIs. Moreover, we have considered a set of similarity metrics for tagged resources to establish a match between music tracks and POIs. In order to test our hypothesis, i.e., that the users will reckon that a music track suits a POI when this track is selected by our approach, we have designed a live user experiment where subjects are repeatedly presented with POIs and a selection of music tracks, some of them matching the presented POI and some not. The results of the experiment show that there is a strong overlap between the users\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u20ac\u00c2\u2122 selections and the best matching music that is recommended by the system for a POI.

We generate recommendations using three approaches: collabo- rative filtering using MinHash clustering, Probabilistic La- tent Semantic Indexing (PLSI), and covisitation counts. We combine recommendations from different algorithms using a linear model. Our approach is content agnostic and con- sequently domain independent, making it easily adaptable for other applications and languages with minimal effort.

Such systems can promote and mediate people's interactions with devices, computers and other people, and they can help navigate unfamiliar places. We believe that a limited amount of information covering a person's proximate environment is most important for this form of computing, since the interesting part of the world around us is what we can see, hear and touch. In this paper, we define context-aware computing and describe four categories of context-aware applications: proximate selection, automatic contextual reconfiguration, contextual information and commands, and content-triggered actions. Instances of these application types have been prototyped on the PARCTAB, a wireless palm-sized computer",

            "content": "A recommender system aims to provide users with personalized online product or service recommendations to handle the increasing online information overload problem and improve customer relationship management. Various recommender system techniques have been proposed since the mid-1990s, and many sorts of recommender system software have been developed recently for a variety of applications. Researchers and managers recognize that recommender systems offer great opportunities and challenges for business, government, education, and other domains, with more recent successful developments of recommender systems for real-world applications becoming apparent. It is thus vital that a high quality, instructive review of current trends should be conducted, not only of the theoretical research results but more importantly of the practical developments in recommender systems. This paper therefore reviews up-to-date application developments of recommender systems, clusters their applications into eight main categories: e-government, e-business, e-commerce/e-shopping, e-library, e-learning, e-tourism, e-resource services and e-group activities, and summarizes the related recommendation techniques used in each category. It systematically examines the reported recommender systems through four dimensions: recommendation methods (such as CF), recommender systems software (such as BizSeeker), real-world application domains (such as e-business) and application platforms (such as mobile-based platforms). Some significant new topics are identified and listed as new directions. By providing a state-of-the-art knowledge, this survey will directly support researchers and practical professionals in their understanding of developments in recommender system applications.",

            "content": "Mobile devices capabilities have increased tremendously over the last few years, enabling mobile users to run resource-heavy applications, such as route planners, web browsers and games, at any time and any place. Much work has been done to facilitate interaction with mobile applications, in mobile settings and on devices with relatively small screens and cumbersome input features. For instance, multi-touch, gesture and voice recognition are deployed to easily execute certain actions, while obtrusiveness of mobile interactions is adapted to suit the user\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u20ac\u00c2\u2122s current situation (e.g., in a meeting). However, mobile interactions still have inherent limitations, mainly due to the fact they are mobile in the first place; mobile users often do not have the time, or the comfortable desktop-setting, to interact with mobile applications. In order to cope with such limitations, the mobile user\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u20ac\u00c2\u2122s context can further be leveraged. Context is defined as any piece of information related to application interaction, including information on the user\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u20ac\u00c2\u2122s surroundings as well as the user and device. By automatically presenting information and services suiting the user\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u20ac\u00c2\u2122s current context, mobile interactions can be enhanced. For example, considering the mobile user\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u20ac\u00c2\u2122s current surroundings and preferences, he can be notified of nearby shops selling items on his shopping list, or nearby public transportation stations leading back to his hotel. In this dissertation, we present a client-side framework to provision context in mobile settings, which exploits recent evolutions in mobile device technology and the World Wide Web. By leveraging increased mobile processing power and memory capacity, computationally intensive tasks, such as context interpretation, integration and dissemination, are performed locally on the mobile device itself. Furthermore, the machine-readable Semantic Web, the next step in the evolution of the Web, is utilized as an online platform for retrieving context data. Much useful context information, describing people, places and things in the user\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u20ac\u00c2\u2122s vicinity, is already captured in small, machine-readable online web sources; including websites (e.g., shops, monuments) and online RDF files (e.g., person profiles). As websites are being increasingly semantically annotated, making the meaning of their content explicit, many of them have become fully-fledged semantic data sources as well. In order to achieve transparent, integrated query access to such small online semantic sources, this dissertation further presents a mobile, client-side query service. This query service comprises indexing and caching components to enable querying such an online dataset on mobile devices.",

Empirical research has shown that, even after school instruction, students do not understand essential ecological concepts. The main reason is that preconceptions which influence learning are not taken into account in the construction of curricula. We combine findings from two independently-designed studies which have their main objectives in common. In both studies the focus is on students' conceptions of ecological terms and phenomena-ecosystem, and balance-and-change in nature. The studies were conducted within the framework of Educational Reconstruction, where three components of research are linked together: 'scientific clarification', 'comprehension of students' perspectives' and 'construction of instruction'. In order to capture the structure and quality of students' conceptions, qualitative methods were used. The results of both studies indicate that students tend to refer to more or less constant properties, in particular those which are visible in the everyday world. Processes are rarely their concern. Therefore the scientific conceptions of ecosystem, imbalance and the dynamics of biodiversity would be difficult for them to understand. For a better understanding, the dimensions of both space and time should be included in curricular design.",

We analyzed this corpus of definitions through two methods, namely LSA [1], [2] and STONE [3], [4], and we conclude that finally the content of all the definitions can be analyzed in terms of few parameters like constraint, influence, behavior, nature, structure and system.",

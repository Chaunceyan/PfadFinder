These papers presented reasons and experimental evidence that showed that the major RDBMS vendors can be outperformed by 1-2 orders of magnitude by specialized engines in the data warehouse, stream processing, text, and scientific database markets. Assuming that specialized engines dominate these markets over time, the current relational DBMS code lines will be left with the business data processing (OLTP) market and hybrid markets where more than one kind of capability is required. In this paper we show that current RDBMSs can be beaten by nearly two orders of magnitude in the OLTP market as well. The experimental evidence comes from comparing a new OLTP prototype, H-Store, which we have built at M.I.T. to a popular RDBMS on the standard transactional benchmark, TPC-C. We conclude that the current RDBMS code lines, while attempting to be a \"one size fits all\" solution, in fact, excel at nothing. Hence, they are 25 year old legacy code lines that should be retired in favor of a collection of \"from scratch\" specialized engines. The DBMS vendors (and the research community) should start with a clean sheet of paper and design systems for tomorrow\u0027s requirements, not continue to push code lines and architectures designed for yesterday\u0027s needs."}

However, existing personal information management tools primarily focus on a limited subset of knowledge work, forcing users to perform additional manual configuration work to integrate the different tools they use. In order to understand tool usage, we review literature on how users\u0027 activities are created and evolve over time as part of knowledge worker practices. From this we derive the activity life cycle, a conceptual framework describing the different states and transitions of an activity. The life cycle is used to inform the design of Laevo, a temporal activity-centric desktop interface for personal knowledge work. Laevo allows users to structure work within dedicated workspaces, managed on a timeline. Through a centralized notification system which doubles as a to-do list, incoming interruptions can be handled. Our field study indicates how highlighting the temporal nature of activities results in lightweight scalable activity management, while making users more aware about their ongoing and planned work."}

Our system \"Presentation Sensei\" is equipped with a microphone and camera to analyze a presentation by combining speech and image processing techniques. Based on the results of the analysis, the system gives the speaker instant feedback with respect to the speaking rate, eye contact with the audience, and timing. It also alerts the speaker when some of these indices exceed predefined warning thresholds. After the presentation, the system generates visual summaries of the analysis results for the speaker\u0027s self-examinations. Our goal is not to improve the content on a semantic level, but to improve the delivery of it by reducing inappropriate basic behavior patterns. We asked a few test users to try the system and they found it very useful for improving their presentations. We also compared the system\u0027s output with the observations of a human evaluator. The result shows that the system successfully detected some inappropriate behavior. The contribution of this work is to introduce a practical recognition-based human training system and to show its feasibility despite the limitations of state-of-the-art speech and video recognition technologies."}

MultiPresenter allows presenters to organize and present pre-made and dynamic presentations that take advantage of a very large display space accessed from a personal laptop. Presenters can use the extra space to provide long-term persistency of information to the audience. Our design deliberately separates content generation (authoring) from the presentation of content. We focus on supporting presentation flow and a variety of presentation styles, ranging from automated, scripted sequences of pre-made slides to highly dynamic ad-hoc, and non-linear content. By providing smooth transition between these styles, presenters can easily alter the flow of content during a presentation to adapt to an audience or to change emphasis in response to emerging interests. We describe our goals, rationale and the design process, providing a detailed description of the current version of the system, and discuss our experience using it throughout a one-semester first year computer science course."}

The state-of-the-art solutions to the Big Data problem are largely based on the MapReduce framework (aka its open source implementation Hadoop). Although Hadoop handles the data volume challenge successfully, it does not deal with the data variety well since MapReduce enforces a key-value data model along with a row-oriented data processing strategy and bundles the data processing model with the underlying concurrent programming model. This paper presents epiC, an extensible system to tackle the Big Dataâs data variety challenge. epiC introduces a general Actor-like concurrent programming model, independent of the data processing models, for specifying parallel computations. Users process multi-structured datasets with appropriate epiC extensions, the implementation of a data processing model best suited for the data type and auxiliary code for mapping that data processing model into epiCâs concurrent programming model. Like Hadoop, programs written in this way can be automatically parallelized and the runtime system takes care of fault tolerance and inter-machine communications. We present the design and implementation of epiCâs concurrent programming model. We also present two customized data processing model, an optimized MapReduce extension and a relational model, on top of epiC. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efï¬ciency of our proposed epiC."}

Rather than exposing real-world data and functionality through proprietary and tightly-coupled systems, we propose to make them an integral part of the Web. As a result, smart things become easier to build upon. Popular Web languages (e.g., HTML, Python, JavaScript, PHP) can be used to easily build applications involving smart things and users can leverage well-known Web mechanisms (e.g., browsing, searching, bookmarking, caching, linking) to interact and share these devices. In this paper, we begin by describing the Web of Things architecture and best-practices based on the RESTful principles that have already contributed to the popular success, scalability, and modularity of the traditional Web. We then discuss several prototypes designed in accordance with these principles to connect environmental sensor nodes and an energy monitoring system to the World Wide Web. We finally show how Web-enabled smart things can be used in lightweight ad-hoc applications called âphysical mashupsâ."}

Aiming to link the multiple visions for the next phase of GIS development, this article suggests that the emerging open GIS should serve as a guiding concept. Contextualized in the broader literature of open science, this article proposes open GIS should include eight dimensions related to data, software, hardware, standards, research, publication, funding, and education. For the GIS community, open GIS offers four exciting opportunities: (1) technology-driven opportunities for addressing challenges posed by the (spatial) big data deluge; (2) application-led opportunities for confronting the problems of a rapidly changing planet; (3) curiosity-inspired, crowd-powered opportunities for the development of an open and geographic citizen science; and (4) education-focused opportunities for implementing the vision of a spatial university. Although there are academic, legal, social/political, and environmental impediments for the practice of open GIS, open GIS will become increasingly important in shaping our research and educational agendas in the future."}

During these deployments we documented how the added display area and increased mi- cro-mobility of multiple devices enhanced navigation and reading comfort. We also noted the essential role of writing and annotation. Finally, we observed how electronic affor- dances like synchronization across devices helped provide functionality that would not have been possible with paper documents.

It is imperative that effective support for managing process variance be extended to organizations mature in their BPM (Business Process Management) uptake so that they can ensure organization wide consistency, promote reuse and capitalize on their BPM investments. Process variants are complex objects that contain features of different dimensions, such as variant design or variant execution data. This paper provides a technique for effective utilization of the adaptations manifested in process variants. In particular, we will present a facility for discovery of preferred variants through effective search and retrieval based on the notion of process similarity, where multiple aspects of the process variants are compared according to specific query requirements. The major advantage of this approach is the ability to provide a quantitative measure for the similarity between process variants, which further facilitates various BPM activities such as process reuse, analysis and discovery."}
